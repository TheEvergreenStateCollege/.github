# CS Townhall

CS Townhall is a time every quarter where students can gather as many CS faculty in one place as possible and ask any question on their minds about computer science and the curriculum at Evergreen. Students can also make computer club or other announcements, or as a community we can celebrate the end of the quarter, or put together a survey to gather feedback.


Faculty have no idea what will be asked, the harder the better.
Facilitators can collect questions leading up to the event, including those from askers who wish to remain anonymous, and choose the questions they deem most interesting to the community.


Some possible questions:

* what are faculty planning to teach next quarter
* advocate or request curriculum
* put together group learning contracts
* how can faculty better coordinate their curriculum, either formally or informally?
* anything you can imagine (related to computation)
